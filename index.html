        <h1> Bio </h1>
         <p>I go by the name of Quinard,  I’m currently 33 years of age,
           and reside in the small city of Hemet. Music has always been a
            passion for me since my younger days. I have come to realize
            that it is the only thing most can’t live without. It can change
            a person day instantly, something so powerful is something I always
            wanted to create. This started out as an expensive hobby, but has now
            turned into something that I want to do full time.  I’m very limited
            on my knowledge of music theory and still struggle to this day to
            learn how to play keyboard and guitar. I lean towards sampling music
            and old records that I have collected throughout the years and some
            acquired from my mother’s collection. Hopefully in due time I touched
            the souls of the people who once touch mines with unforeseen talent
             of mines.
