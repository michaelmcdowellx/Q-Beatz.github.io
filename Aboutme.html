       <p>I go by the name of Quinard,  I’m currently 33 years of age, and reside in the small city of Hemet. Music has always been a passion for me since my younger days. I have come to realize that it is the only thing most can’t live without. It can change a person day instantly, something so powerful is something I always wanted to create. This started out as an expensive hobby, but has now turned into something that I want to do full time.  I’m very limited on my knowledge of music theory and still struggle to this day to learn how to play keyboard and guitar. I lean towards sampling music and old records that I have collected throughout the years and some acquired from my mother’s collection. Hopefully in due time I touched the souls of the people who once touch mines with unforeseen talent of mines.
